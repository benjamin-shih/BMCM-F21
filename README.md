# Brown Mathematical Modeling Contest Fall 2021

Our submission and code for the BMCM 2021, for which we responded to Prompt 2 regarding the best combination of hazard reduction burning (HRB) and logging strategies to mitigate Australian bushfires. Our submission won the [Brown competition](https://www.dam.brown.edu/siam/bmcm.html) and took home prize money as well as university sponsorship to the [international contest (IMCM)](https://www.comap.com/undergraduate/contests/).

Please consult our written paper and notebook for more information on models and techniques used as well as simulation strategy and results.
